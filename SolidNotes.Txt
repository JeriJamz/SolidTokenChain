#really just thing I need to remember for Solid like...
*"Address" a unique indentfier that repersent the user on the blockchain
"mapping" just solidity version of a dictionary
"constructor" is called to make new contract and cannot be called otherwise
"msg" a special global variable that contains properties to #*I think your personal blockchain Idk yet*# the blockchain
"Mint" sends an amount of new of tokens you want to send out
"send"#Ima assume means you want to SEND out tokens but ima leave it a comment til kill confirm
"require" this pretty simple but got a catch. Its in the name but its basically a sp! of special condition that moves the stack to its own indepent eviorment and push or pop depending if all conditions are met
#*
Ok Ok I gots to add this
(msg.sender==minter)
this line ensures whoever is the creator of this newblock chain can mint new tokens...
