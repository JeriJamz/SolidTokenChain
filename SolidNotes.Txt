#really just thing I need to remember for Solid like...
*"Address" a unique indentfier that repersent the user on the blockchain
"mapping" just solidity version of a dictionary
"constructor" is called to make new contract and cannot be called otherwise
"msg" a special global variable that contains properties to #*I think your personal blockchain Idk yet*# the blockchain
"Mint" sends an amount of new of tokens you want to send out
"send"#Ima assume means you want to SEND out tokens but ima leave it a comment til kill confirm
"require" this pretty simple but got a catch. Its in the name but its basically a sp! of special condition that moves the stack to its own indepent eviorment and push or pop depending if all conditions are met
#*
Ok Ok I gots to add this
(msg.sender==minter)
this line ensures whoever is the creator of this newblock chain can mint new tokens...
New lauches gone love this LMAOOO #side comment where my memes at?

#*SOLIDITY GOT A BUFFEROVERFLOW LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO THERES MINIMAL CHECK

The Furry hackers gone loves this LMAOOOO WHERE MY MEME

*BlockChain Basics:
    Its going to tell on you. Its a database with public output. Its called a ledger
    There is mutable data like ownership. One way to change data on the chains is to have a transaction:
        That everyone on the blockchain agree with
        Once a transaction is set it becomes and inmutable? Unmutable data type
        All transactions are signed cryptically by the sender
    -Blocks:
        "Double-Spend Attacks" are an obvious vulnarblity to the program. Due to validation-checks and strain of the system. When two transactions what to empty an account; The problem arise:
            Usally the first request to apper to the system is the honored request but:
                Due to well physics, friction and your internet provider. Its not guranteed the first to apper is the intial request
#*Side note. If time Time out your home server and make a request and get it placed before yours
can I have your account? Good things these are PUBLIC ledgers*#
#Oh this is a bad security check thank goodness everything is public. Bc aint no regulation
            "Attestation":
                is where blocks in the chain are reverted for whatever reason to ease stress it catered to newer blocks. So Newbie uncle sam can audit you... I mean the chain can

#*

let me sum the account a lil better. The address and access tokens for contract accounts are on a peice of hardware
the External account need external input from something and can transfer software to software... So its basically virtual. "TLDR"

*#
    -Accounts:
        There are two type of accounts:
            (1)"External"; which is just human controlled
            (2)"Contract Accounts"; Which is controlled by a couple lines of code
        Every accounts use 256-bit strings(Im not calling them words when its string values). That is called storage
        Every account also has a balnce:
            wei = 1 Ethrum = 10**18 wei#WTF is the currency and conversion. Thats a lot of Weis can you find a path?
    -transactions:
        Its the kinda-private ledger.
        Payloads are super important. Its the Badge the receipt. THE PAPERWORK. Its actual data you want sent from your account to the other... Its treated as input data... Here

#[Sender(Output)]>data>data>BOOM Payload(Inputdata) > InToo>[Here]
#this is also meant to be ByteCode which noice to always check fo. Also it isnt yo actual contract just a verifier in a way
        Ok this is fun when there is no reciever. That program "Mints" a new contract
        "Nonce" Is a memory address deriving from the:
            Address of the sender and the number of transactions that is being preformed

    -Gas:
        |Tax| Basically a tax thats paid to an orginator of whatever block of what ever chain.
#heres a line (tx.orgin)lol tax.toOrgin
        Gas is not smokey... so its paid to whoever discovered the coin. Its tech a compensation. It has a Gas Limit
#how its set fuck knows but god
        Each transaction from this chain is supposed to pay the tax and help die down the cost
        #My main wonder is if the gas is used up can you still use the chain... prolly its just you dont have to pay the miner anymore

    -StoMemStack:
        Storage is the 256-bit string that is called "storage":
            stays in btw two modes Transactions and Fuction Calls#PHP?
            Storage#*Lets say Variables*# are not priortize so keep it to a minimum...Pointer?
            Sole contracts can only mutate thier data storage
        Memory:
            Dude its DDRAM... or worse VRAM...Super volitile and limited:
            reads 256-bits so the storage and writes 256 or 8 bits long
            Over using Memory especially bc of storage leads to higher Taxes(aint saying gas)#Scales quadradically... why?
        Stack:
            ...EVM is an EVM and not a Kernal so ya kno Stack it ontop of your OS and BOOM its Kali Linux
            Specs:
                1024 element limit...bits?
                256-bits are used already to read your contract
                theres 16 Elements you can gain access two(IK):
                    you can get access and start to push pop and swap things

************************SIDENOTE***************************

Message calls pay people who aint got a contract and watnot

SO if an exception happens in the innercall thier is an excpetion that basically acts as a plug and needs 
Mannul love from a neckbeard LMAO magine that
the term is "Bubble Up The Stack"... til ya poke it
...finna program brb
