#might as well start on curves

* y**2 = x**3+ax+b #I think this is the standard elyptic curve
#nice reminder y = mx + b is just a line
*elyptic curves use two curvatures instead of one. #think thats what make this encryption a little more diffrent
    -they dont always have to connect
        +its called disjoint
    -cubic equations can also make an elyptic curve#I like this spelling better
#bit-coin use y**3 + x**2 + 7(still trying to figure how this is encryprion)
    -there another form called connical:
        y**2 = x**x+ax+b :
            a is the constant #bitcoin got it where it is sat as 0
            b is 7 #is the tech a private variable that cant be change by the user? private void b???
