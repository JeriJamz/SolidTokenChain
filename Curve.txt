#might as well start on curves

* y**2 = x**3+ax+b #I think this is the standard elyptic curve
#nice reminder y = mx + b is just a line
*elyptic curves use two curvatures instead of one. #think thats what make this encryption a little more diffrent
    -they dont always have to connect
        +its called disjoint
    -cubic equations can also make an elyptic curve#I like this spelling better
#bit-coin use y**3 + x**2 + 7(still trying to figure how this is encryprion)
    -there another form called connical:
        y**2 = x**x+ax+b :
            a is the constant #bitcoin got it where it is sat as 0
            b is 7 #is the tech a private variable that cant be change by the user? private void b???
#noice note to remember Point math start as P1(x1,y1),P2(x1,y1)
#we getting into math so here
(1) Point Math:
    Points in Elyptic curves are meh. Grab two points btw the curve:#books says they addition points so A & B
        to find a third point. Draw a stright line and find the interception:#this is point C
            The 4th point and just reflected over the thrid point#This is point AB
#*
*I love Math has laws so I can always check myself
*A+B should be on the right of the graph
*A+C should be in between A & C on the X-Axis
*The Sum of B+C would have both points on the left(negative) side of the graph#Easy Law

Now im just brushing up on math:
*Identity: There is a 0 thats is a root constant that when added to another varibale or integer, you result in no decramentation or incramention
*invertablity: Simple The balance. If it is a postive you should be able to find its negation.(Negative Number). When adding the two. The sum should result in the root number or indentifier constant
*Commutativity: Another simple one. When a Mathmatical Operations has addition or multiplication operands and intergers(Keep It in the unsigned ranged) No matter the order you should yeild constant results
Associativity:... Nope Noooooope Just figure this Point addition Mathmatical Operations that can reflect and mirrage image another formula
